# Sketch_Animate

This is the second repo associated with the Animating Children's Sketches projects. This project takes the outputs generated by sketch_rig and applies motion capture data onto them.

## Setup

	conda create --name sketch_animate python=3.7
	conda activate sketch_animate
	git clone git@github.com:fairinternal/sketch_animate.git
	cd sketch_animate
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	
To ensure setup worked, try running the following example:

	./main.sh example_interact.yaml cameras_ssf.yaml
	# controls: spacebar to start and stop animation, wasd to translate camera, mouse to rotate camera, exit to stop
	
## Running with new images
To try with output from sketch_rig repo, 

Copy the files from ${OUTPUT_DIR}/animation_files in sketch_animate/Data/Texture

Create a new config file:

	cp sketch_animate/configs/example_interact.yaml sketch_animate/configs/example2.yaml

Update 'character_config' in example2.yaml to point to the .yaml file that was copied from ${OUTPUT_DIR}/animation_files

Run it:
	
	./main.sh example2.yaml cameras_ssf.yaml
	
If you want to try another motion, change 'motion' in example2.yaml to point to a different motion file within Data/BVH

Vary the angle of projection for the upper limbs, lower limbs, and torso, by varying the second .yaml file passed in main.sh

	camera_fff.yaml # will project all motion onto a frontal plane
	camera_fsf.yaml # will project upper body motion onto a frontal plane, lower body motion onto a saggital plane, and torso motion onto a frontal plane
	camera_fss.yaml # will project upper body motion onto a frontal plane, lower body motion onto a saggital plane, and torso motion onto a saggital plane
	camera_ssf.yaml # will project upper body motion onto a saggital plane, lower body motion onto a frontal  plane, and torso motion onto a frontal plane
	camera_ssf.yaml # will project upper body motion onto a saggital plane, lower body motion onto a saggital plane, and torso motion onto a frontal plane
	camera_sss.yaml # will project all motion onto a saggital plane
